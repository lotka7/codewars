// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
// Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
// Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

// You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.
// Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.
// Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.

getAge('5 years old')

// Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from ato z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.
// Examples:
// a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
// b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
// longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

// a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
// longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
